# Chl_visualisation
💁 A Jupyter notebook describing the way of mapping chlorophyll-a concentration in the ocean using the main packages such as xarray and pygmt. 

🌎 In this notebook, we will be processing 22 years chlorophyll monthly data from Corpenicus Marine Service (Global Ocean Colour (Copernicus-GlobColour), Bio-Geo-Chemical, L4 (monthly and interpolated) from Satellite Observations (1997-ongoing)) (https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/OCEANCOLOUR_GLO_BGC_L4_MY_009_104/description) using xarray package in python along with dask.

💻 After processing the 22 years data, we will present in a video, showing monthly anomalies in percentage compared with the climatology across past 22 years using generic mapping tools written in python package named pygmt.
